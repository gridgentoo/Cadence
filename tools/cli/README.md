Documentation for the Cadence command line interface is located at our [main site](https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/08_cli).

## Quick Start
Run `make bins` from the project root. You should see an executable file called `cadence`. Try a few example commands to 
get started:   
`./cadence` for help on top level commands and global options   
`./cadence domain` for help on domain operations  
`./cadence workflow` for help on workflow operations  
`./cadence tasklist` for help on tasklist operations  
(`./cadence help`, `./cadence help [domain|workflow]` will also print help messages)

**Note:** Make sure you have a Cadence server running before using the CLI.
